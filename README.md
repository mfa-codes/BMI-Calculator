# BMI-Calculator

This is a small and simple application that I developed with Angular. 
In this application it will calculate and display the body-mass-index-value (BMI) using the data entered (body weight & height).

for this application I used of course only HTML, SCSS and TypeScript. you can clone or download the "src" folders
